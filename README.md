#ascript

Short for annoying script. An annoying script language.

#TODO:

- Make the parser understand decimal values. Should not be hard, just check
if it's just numbers and a single dot xD!

- Function parameters.

- Yield... I wonder a LOT about this.

- interpreter is next.
	- i guess we'll need the host interface.
	- the interpreter must be fed with scripts
	- the interpreter must tic every tick
	- the interpreter can next be asked to run(scriptname, paramlist)
