#ascript

Short for annoying script. An annoying script language.

#TODO:

- Yield... I wonder a LOT about this.
- Calling OTHER functions.
	- Add the function to the stack, as simple as that. 
- Provide a way to erase data from the host????
- Provide an out interface (basically anything that supports <<)
- Provide a default std::cout implementation of such interface.
- Provide a wrapper class that stores scripts per name?
- Check TODOs.
- Write tests of all the language features so we can know what to expect.
- Document.
