#ascript

Short for annoying script. An annoying script language.

##BUGS:

- After a loop, the symbol table should be reset!!!!

##TODO:

- Functions that return values (???) (let thing be call ["a"]; return ["blah"];
- Provide an out interface (basically supports out of strings, doubles, integers and booleans).
- Provide a default std::cout implementation of such interface.
- Cleanup arguments / parameters name, they should not be interchangeable in a readable codebase.
- Check TODOs.
- Document classes.
- Write small manual.
- Write tests of all the language features so we can know what to expect.
- Do a char by char tokenizer, the one we have has slight bugs.
