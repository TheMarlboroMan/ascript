Here's where I lay out ideas and shit...

So, I have a "script" wich is a list of contexts... I could write something
that runs it provided that...

	- It has a symbol table for all the shit.
	- later i can add parameters as part of the symbol table.

class interpreter {

	public:
	void            run(const script&, const std::vector<variable>& parameters);
	
};
